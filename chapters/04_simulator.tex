\section{Simulator}
The results presented in this work have been obtained using the ns-3 network simulator tool. Ns-3 is a discrete-events network simulator specifically targeted to the research world.

There are a few reasons why this choice was made. First and foremost, the fact that this is a full-stack simulator played a crucial role, 

\section{Scenario}
The simulated scenario consisted of a simple setup including a single \ac{UE} ground terminal connected to a satellite acting as \ac{gNB}. The satellite is then connected via an ideal link with no latency and high throughput to a node that acts as second endpoint of the communication.

The parameters of the satellite antenna follow the scenario 10 DL indicated in TR 38.321 \todo{insert reference} and are reported in the code snippets \ref{code:sat_parameters} and \ref{code:ue_parameters}.
